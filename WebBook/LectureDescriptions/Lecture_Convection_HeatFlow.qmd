# Lecture - Convection and the Connection to Heat Flow

Once we establish that the Earth's mantle has vigorous convective activity, we can start to make a connection to the observables at the Earth's surface such as the heat flow and the plate velocity. We revisit some classic results to show that an understanding of thermal boundary layers is the key to determining plate evolution.

A lecture can have some notes and a slideshow.

The embedding is via an `html iframe` that points to the built path (all the slides are rendered into the
slideshows directory at the `root` level of the book)
