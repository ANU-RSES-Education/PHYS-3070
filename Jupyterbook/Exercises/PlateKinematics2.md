Note, you are strongly advised to complete [part I](PlateKinematics1) of this exercise before trying part II. It is also quite difficult to work out the triple junction evolution without an opportunity to discuss this with the rest of the class.

You will find an exercise quite like this in Gubbins’ book “Seismology & Plate Tectonics” and in Fowler’s “The Solid Earth” — there may be some hints for you there, but not actual answers !!  

Their versions of this practical are intended to be solved by drawing / measurement but this version is much more user-friendly when it comes to calculations. The numbers are chosen to give round numbers or simple fractions when you calculate the vectors (that's a helpful hint !). 

<a href="../Figures/PDFs/StylizedEastPacificBasemap.pdf"> This basemap</a> is drawn to scale and the vectors are provided in flat-Earth form. You can draw or calculate your answers to this prac. 

::::{admonition} Q1 Relative Plate Velocities (2/20)
Find the relative velocities of plates A & B  (i.e. $_A V_B$ or $_B V_A$) and B & C in vector form as given in the diagram.

::::{admonition} Q2 Absolute Plate Velocities (3/20)
Now calculate the absolute plate velocities for plates A, C, D (i.e. assuming that plate F is the fixed plate, what are $_F V_A$, $_F V_C$, $_F V_D$.)

::::{admonition} Q3 Triple Junction Velocities (5/20)
Find the absolute motions of the triple junctions $RRR_1$ and $RFF_1$ (we might choose the notation $_F V_{RFF_1}$ for this) and the steps in the ridge system indicated by $RF_{(1-7)}$. These need to be constructed by considering how the plates evolve with time and using the absolute / relative plate motions calculated previously.

::::{admonition} Q4 Triple Junction Updated Positions (5/20)
Now, given the scale of the diagram, plot where each of the points identified in question 3 will be after 10 Myr, 20 Myr and so on up to 50Myr into the future and hence the plate configuration at each interval. How many plates are there by 40Myr and by 50 Myr (identify them) ?

::::{admonition} Q5 Triple Junction Updated Positions (5/20)
On a copy of the 40Myr configuration, draw the sea-floor stripes back to the original time (0 Myr). You can choose the reversals but at least 5 stripes, please !  Be careful to show any scales that you use to generate the stripes. Mark the fracture zones and show carefully the pattern of stripes around the RRR triple junction. Now sketch the 50Myr configuration and explain what differences there are in the stripes from the 40Myr configuration.
