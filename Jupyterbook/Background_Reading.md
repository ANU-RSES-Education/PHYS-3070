## Papers 

These are some of the classic (i.e. early but ultimately prescient) papers that can be very helpful to read because they are very insightful and intuitive examinations of quite sparse observations.

- Wilson, J. T. (1963). CONTINENTAL DRIFT. Scientific American, 208(4), 86–103. https://doi.org/10.1038/scientificamerican0463-86. *This paper came very early in the evolution of the plate tectonic paradigm but outlines a version of the theory that has changed very little despite the vastly increased observational data that subsequently became available*

- Heezen, B. C., & Tharp, M. (1965). Tectonic fabric of the Atlantic and Indian oceans and continental drift. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 258, 90–106. https://doi-org.virtual.anu.edu.au/10.1098/rsta.1965.0024. *Marie Tharp was a driving force behind the mapping of the sea-floor and the rendering of the bathymetry into a now-ubiquitous relief map*

- Wilson, J. T. (1965). A New Class of Faults and their Bearing on Continental Drift. Nature, 207(4995), 343–347. https://doi.org/10/b4vzck. *Transform faults in the ocean-floor were first explained as such by Tuzo Wilson an observation of incredible significance for the plate tectonic framework*

- Vine, F. (1968). Magnetic anomalies associated with mid-ocean ridges. In The history of the earth’s crust (pp. 73–89). Princeton University Press Princeton, NJ. *The observation of the magnetic reversals stamped into the oceanic crust by spreading set the scene for plate kinematic reconstruction. This paper is a mature synthesis of earlier contributions but still one of the foundation works of plate tectonics*

- McKENZIE, D. P., & Morgan, W. J. (1969). Evolution of Triple Junctions. Nature, 224, 125–133. *In plate kinematics, the behaviour of triple junctions is predictable and their evolution through time can be used for reconstruction. This paper is a complete analysis of what happens if we assume the kinematic rules of plate boundary evolution are precisely satisfied in the ocean*

- Dewey, J. F. (1972). PLATE TECTONICS. Scientific American, 226(5), 56–72. https://doi.org/10.1038/scientificamerican0572-56. *Dewey makes the connection between oceanic plate motion and continental tectonics in a way that does not over-complicate the continental side of the picture*

- Tapponnier, P., Peltzer, G., Dain, A. Y. L., Armijo, R., & Cobbold, P. (1982). Propagating extrusion tectonics in Asia: New insights from simple experiments with plasticine. Geology, 10, 611–616. https://doi.org/10/bmzcmt. *A paper that proposes the concept of "escape tectonics" which recognises that continental deformation is not just driven by boundary forces but also by the balance between crustal thickening and gravitational potential energy*.
