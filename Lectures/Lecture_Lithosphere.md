# Lecture - Deformation of the lithosphere 

It's difficult to ignore the fact that the convecting mantle is beneath a strong and heterogeneous layer of lithosphere. We will have trouble understanding what the mantle is doing if we don't know how to deconvolve the filter that the lithosphere imposes on signals from depth. In this lecture we run focus on *topography* and the way in which elasticity of the lithosphere, changes in crustal thickness in response to lateral stresses, and glacial isostatic adjustment of the free surface.
