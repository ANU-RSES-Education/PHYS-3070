    "text": "Introduction\nThe course is an introduction to physics of the solid Earth intended for students with substantial background in physics and mathematics including calculus. The course will provide an overview of the structure and evolution of the Earth as a dynamic planet within our solar system. Physical principles will be applied to the following topics: theory of elasticity and elastic wave propagation; modern global seismology as a probe of the Earth’s internal structure; earthquakes and the description of seismic sources; a simple but fundamental theory of thermal convection; the distinctive rheological behaviour of the upper mantle and its top layer, controlled by significant changes in the mechanical properties of the material, will then be explored to arrive at a comprehensive description of what forces drive and resist global plate motions.\n\nHonours Pathway Option\nStudents taking the HP / advanced option will undertake an individual project on a topic of interest from the course syllabus. Such project shall develop in consultation with the course lecturers, and may be in the form of a reading project or a laboratory/numerical experiment accompanied by a final report. The assessment of the project will be agreed upon and undertaken in a manner appropriate to the project itself (e.g. a written report or essay, a short talk etc.). Students taking the HP option may elect to substitute their project mark either with up to two (out of four) individual assignments or with one of the experiments and accompanying report normally undertaken during the course (this amounts to a total of 10-20% of the final grade). The assessment weight towards the exam will remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLT\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Thermal boundary layers play an important role in geodynamics because the “plates” that make up the oceanic lithosphere are boundary layers. The oceanic heat flow and depth can be understood from simple boundary layer theory although there are a number of steps we need to take before we can get to that point.",

In a 1982 paper, Huppert found a mathematical expression for the spreading of viscous fluids on a flat surface. The solution assumes either fixed volume or a known injection rate. For a fixed volume, the solution is interesting because it keeps the same shape but just scales horizontally / vertically.\n\n\n\nThe solution looks like this:\n\\[ h(r,t) = \\nu_N^{2/3}  t^{-1/4} \\phi(\\nu/\\nu_N) \\]\nwhere \\(\\nu =  r t^{-1 / 8}\\) and \\(\\phi({\\nu}/{\\nu_N}) = \\left( \\frac{3}{16}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\left( 1-\\left({\\nu}/{\\nu_N}\\right)^2 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\).\n\\(\\nu_N\\) is a constant with a value close to 1. The solution is made up of two parts: a scaling that stretches the shape in the radial direction and shrinks it in the vertical direction as time progresses, and the other part is the shape itself (the function \\(\\phi\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: 8 / 25\n\n\n\nMake a sketch or plot of \\(h(x)\\) at four different values of \\(t\\): 1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nThis looks a bit complicated but first write a function to compute \\(\\nu(r,t)\\) and then a function to compute \\(\\phi(\\nu)\\).\n\\(\\phi(\\nu)\\) is only valid if $ 0 &lt; &lt; 1$ so be sure to check and return 0.0 if \\(\\nu\\) is outside that range (it will be since you want to plot a region into which the blob begins to spread).\n\nCalculate values up to r=4.0.

If you look closely, you will see that we mostly left out the constants and material properties from these examples (especially 2 and 3) as it just makes it more complicated to write out.\nIf you are interested in seeing the derivations in more detail, you should take a look at the book Geodynamics by Turcotte & Schubert. The elastic flexure equations are in chapter 3, and the derivation of the boundary layer structure for the oceanic lithosphere is in chapter 4 (of the 2nd edition which is the more commonly available version).",
