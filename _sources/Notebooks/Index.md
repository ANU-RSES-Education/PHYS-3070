These online practicals are in the form of Jupyter notebooks that you can access from this page once you have logged into the server. You may be logged out if you are away for a while but once you return to this page, your work should be saved. Any computer system can fail, however, so you should download a backup of any work that you want to keep. 

## Jupyter Notebooks

Typically, a markdown (`myst` format) file is used for text that is not going to be executed as a notebook.
