# Lecture - Continuum Mechanics Background

In this lecture, we will examine the coupled problem of heat-flow and fluid mechanics under the conditions that apply to the Earth's mantle / lithosphere system. We will see how the relevant equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation are derived and which non-dimensional parameters control the behaviour. We will also gain some intuition into the way these non-dimensional parameters influence the dynamics and how we expect that to play out for planets.
