# Exercises: Plate Kinematics (II)

Note, you are strongly advised to complete [part I](PlateKinematics1) of this exercise before trying part II. It is also quite difficult to work out the triple junction evolution without an opportunity to discuss this with the rest of the class.

You will find an exercise quite like this in Gubbins’ book “Seismology & Plate Tectonics” and in Fowler’s “The Solid Earth” — there may be some hints for you there, but not actual answers !!  Their versions of this practical are intended to be solved by drawing / measurement but this version is much more user-friendly when it comes to calculations. The numbers are chosen to give round numbers or simple fractions when you calculate the vectors (that's a helpful hint !). 



[This basemap](Figures/kinematics/StylizedEastPacificBasemap.pdf) is drawn to scale and the vectors are provided in flat-Earth form. You can draw or calculate your answers to this prac. 


 1	2 Marks

Find the relative velocities of plates A & B  (i.e. AVB or BVA) and B & C in vector form as given in the diagram. 
Question 2 	3 Marks
Now calculate the absolute plate velocities for plates A, C, D (i.e. assuming that plate F is the fixed plate, what are FVA, FVC, FVD.)
Question 3	5 Marks
Find the absolute motions of the triple junctions RRR1 and RFF1 (we might choose the notation FVRFF1 for this) and the steps in the ridge system indicated by RF(1-7). These need to be constructed by considering how the plates evolve with time and using the absolute / relative plate motions calculated previously.
Question 4	5 Marks
Now, given the scale of the diagram, plot where each of the points identified in question 3 will be after 10 Myr, 20 Myr and so on up to 50Myr into the future and hence the plate configuration at each interval. How many plates are there by 40Myr and by 50 Myr (identify them) ?
Question 5	5 Marks
On a copy of the 40Myr configuration, draw the sea-floor stripes back to the original time (0 Myr). You can choose the reversals but at least 5 stripes, please !  Be careful to show any scales that you use to generate the stripes. Mark the fracture zones and show carefully the pattern of stripes around the RRR triple junction. Now sketch the 50Myr configuration and explain what differences there are in the stripes from the 40Myr configuration.

What is the magnitude in cm/yr of the half-spreading rate between plates A & B in the three-plate system in the diagram ?  

Draw a selection of magnetic stripes on this diagram (in the reference frame of the triple junction to make things simple).

If we assume that plate A is fixed, which of the 3 configurations below represents the correct movement of the triple junction and three ridges from their original location (shown in black) to their new location a year later (shown in red). 

   1. Configuration 1

::::{admonition} 2.3 RRR triple junction vectors

Which combination of relative velocity vectors for the diagram of the ridge-ridge-ridge triple junction below is a possible solution . 


![](Figures/kinematics/TripleJunctionExerciseFigure3.svg)

Notes: (1) the diagram is drawn to scale, although you don’t need this information to answer the question !      (2) you should read $_X V _Y$ as the relative velocity of plate Y with respect to plate X. The units are not important to answer the question but let's say they are all cm/yr.

  1. $_A V _B$ = ( 5, 6 ); $_B V _C$ =  ( 2, 4 ); $_C V _A$ = ( 3, 2 ) 	  
  2. $_A V _B$ = ( 5, 0 ); $_B V _C$ =  ( 1, 2 ); $_C V _A$ = ( 4,-2 ) 	  
  3. $_A V _B$ = (-5, 0 ); $_B V _C$ =  (-1, 2 ); $_C V _A$ = ( 6,-1 ) 	  
  4. $_A V _B$ =  (5, 0 ); $_B V _C$ = ( -1,-2 ); $_C V _A$ = ( -4, 2)

<div style="width:50%;float:right;" >

![](Figures/kinematics/TripleJunctionExerciseFigure4.svg)

</div>

Which of the plate boundary configurations in the diagram is not possible under the standard rules of plate tectonics (i.e. it's locking / cannot evolve forward in time) ?   Explain your reasoning. 
Note. The velocity vectors are not drawn precisely to scale.

</div>

In the diagram on the right ...  

Is the plate boundary between plates A and C (dotted) a transform, spreading centre or subduction zone ?

What is the magnitude of the velocity across this plate boundary ?

Is the sense of the offset along the left-hand transform branch of the ABC triple junction actually left lateral (as marked) or should it have been drawn as a right lateral transform fault ? 

What is the separation / convergence velocity of the line p-p' ?

What is the separation / convergence velocity of the line q-q' ?

What is the separation / convergence velocity of the line r-r' ?

*Hint: figure out the plate velocities relative to, say, plate A first of all, and then you can answer these questions relatively easily. Also, remember the spreading rate marked is the half spreading rate*

Now sketch some magnetic stripes for this system.
