## Exercises - Lava Lamp Demonstration of Thermochemical Convection

This exercise is intended to be an at-home practical demonstration of thermo-chemical convection. All the ingredients are commonly available from the supermarket and most of them are everyday kitchen items.

## Background

Our zero-order picture of the Earth's convecting mantle / plate-tectonic system is of an isoviscous, Rayleigh-BÃ©nard, overturning layer which can be characterised by a single Rayleigh number with

$$
Ra = \frac{g \rho \alpha \Delta T d^3}{\kappa \eta}
$$ 

and this model does a very good job of explaining how the heat flow (and hence depth) in the oceanic lithosphere varies with age. 

The *other* zero-order observation about the Earth is that the continents and the oceans are fundamental different in the way that they respond to convective forcing from the mantle. The oceanic lithosphere is very obviously part of the convecting system while the continental lithosphere is very obviously not. This stands out in the dichotomy in the age distribution (oceans are all young, continents don't have to be and can be very, very old). The primary reason for this difference is the buoyancy of continental crust that prevents it from being recycled *en masse* by mantle convection. 

This is a form of *thermochemical convection*: a system in which compositional as well as thermal buoyancy plays a role. Convection can be driven by compositional effects (e.g. the primary driving mechanism for convection in the Earth's outer core is the release of lighter fluid by crystalisation of the inner core) or it can be opposed by the inherent buoyancy associated with compositional variations. This is the situation for the continental crust which is negatively buoyant due to thermal effects (it's cold) and positively buoyant because it is an immiscible, light material. The D'' layer is the mirror image of this situation found at the core-mantle boundary.

Corresponding to the familiar thermal Rayleigh number is an equivalent quantity that accounts for the  buoyancy difference between materials with different composition. Here we assume that there is a *compositional field* analogous to temperature with 0 and 1 representing the two end-member compositions. 

$$
    Ra_C = \frac{\Delta \rho g d^3}{\kappa \eta}
$$

We will also assume that the composition does not diffuse (hence the thermal diffusivity provides the timescale) which is a very reasonable assumption for the large-scale examples of our whole-Earth model.

## The Lava Lamp

To learn more about the dynamics of the Earth, we turn to the space-race inspired household [*Astro Lamp* (a.k.a. Lava Lamp)](https://www.mathmos.com.au/home.php). In the 1960s, the mesmerising, dancing fluids of the ubiquitous lava lamp symbolised a future of peace and prosperity and the glamorous life of the [international jet set](https://untappedcities.com/2013/05/28/inside-lax-airport-theme-building-modernist-icon/). 


The lava lamp consists of two immiscible liquids of different density (and contrasting colour) in a clear bottle and an incandescent bulb as a heat source. The density of the two fluids is close enough that heating the denser one by a few degrees is enough to make it lighter than the other. The competition between composition and temperature results in the chaotic and unpredictable behaviour over time and the relaxing effect. The viscosity of the lava (heavier) component of the lamp is important (aesthetically) because it determines the size and speed of the rising drips that form in the lamp. 


## Hands on Lava

To build a lava lamp of our own, our first goal is to find two immiscible liquids of similar density. Safety calls for materials than be handled in the home without special protective equipment and we need to be able to heat everything up without it catching fire or giving off poisonous fumes.

So let's imagine we restrict ourselves to items from the food section of the supermarket. We might consider edible oil and water for our two immiscible fluids as we already know that they are immiscible. The question is whether they are close enough in density to overturn when heated and whether it matters that the low density oil is also the more viscous of the two fluids.

We are interested in following the different modes of behaviour as the relative density differences change and how these trade off with the thermal buoyancy changes. We can change the temperature difference, the container size and the choice of materials. We can also fine tune the densities of the fluids themselves if we add some secondary components miscible with only one of the two (e.g salt in water to make it more dense).

The exercise itself is to document the process of **designing** and then **building** the lava-lamp and making a connection to the physics of the Earth. The actual lava lamp is configured with much more overturning than we see between the continental crust and the mantle but we learn quite a bit more if we study the cases close to a transition in behaviour. 

Practical details that are important to consider:

 - you will need a glass container that is not at risk of cracking or shattering when heated (a pyrex measuring jug, for example, or laboratory glassware that you happen to be able to rehome for a short while in your kitchen).
 - and you want a heat source that does not risk igniting anything. If you only have a gas stove, consider using a large frying pan over low heat to provide a uniform, moderate temperature surface and maybe using water to keep the temperature capped at 100&deg;.
 - good lighting so you can see what is going on.
 - a camera / phone that you can use to record experiments and a means of supporting it hands free.
 - measuring cylinder and digital scale to estimate densities (optional)
 - a thermometer to estimate temperatures (optional)
 - ink, dyes, crayons, candles, food colouring, oil / water paint etc to experiment with visualisation

::::{admonition} Instructions 

The task is to run the lava lamp experiment and make the connection between the thermochemical convection "regimes" that you see in the experiment and those in the Earth (e.g. continental crust v. mantle; D'' layer v. mantle; cratonic lithospheric roots v. phanerozoic).

Explore not only the classical lava lamp (almost-balanced) regime, but also the other end members with compositional buoyancy dominant (and more viscous / less viscous on top). 

Explore the effects of changing $Ra$, for example by changing the layer depth or the basal temperature. 

Write up a report and brief presentation that explains the relevance to the Earth and concentrate on what you have learned from undertaking the experiment. Include any advice you have for anyone coming back to try their own lava lamp.

## What do we learn ?

It doesn't matter whether the lava lamp works like the real thing, what we learn is how the changes in density associated with composition (unchanging in a given experiment) and that associated with temperature (changing as a result of advection and diffusion of heat) interact to produce complicated, chaotic dynamics. 

The experiment can be quite revealing and challenging:

 - Can you visualise the convective motion inside the layers and the blobs as they form ?
 - Is the thermal expansivity of each material the same and does it affect the experiments ?
 - Is the convective vigour really proportional to $d^3$ ?  
 - Can you document examples you see in your experiments that apply to other geophysical problems such as salt diapirs or lithospheric drips (Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities) ? 
 - How can we make this experiment more quantitative ?
 - Are there any tricks that you figured out that you want to pass along ?
