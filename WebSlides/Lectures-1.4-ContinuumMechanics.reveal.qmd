# Mantle Convection

Convection in Earth’s interior is (a little bit) like a boiling pot (as we saw in a previous lecture)

<center>

![](images/USGS-ConvectionCartoon.png){fig-align="center" height="300px"} &nbsp;
![](images/AWatchedPot.png){fig-align="center" height="300px"}

</center>

The hot soup rises to the surface, spreads and begins to cool, and then sinks back to the bottom of the pot where it is reheated and rises again. **Why does hot soup rise and cold soup sink** ?



# General Observations on Convection

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="66%"}
Without being particularly quantitative:

  - Hot liquid is more buoyant than cold material **and it tends to rise**
  - Cooler liquid is less buoyant and **therefore tends to sink**
  - This can only happen if the two can **move past each other**
  - Convection produces a self-stirring

:::

![](images/AWatchedPot.png){fig-align="right" height="200px"}

Buoyancy forces are at work and viscous forces counteract these forces once the fluid is moving

$$
\textrm{buoyancy} \propto g \rho_0 \alpha(1-\Delta T)
$$

Convection like this will only work when the soup is heated from below or, in the case of the Earth, if it is heated from within by radioactivity. **(Can you see why) ?**


## General Observations on Convection

**Definition**:  Convection is the transfer of heat by the self-organised movement of a fluid. Free convection is when the fluid is stirred entirely by rising buoyant material and sinking negatively-buoyant material. (Forced convection is produced when the fluid is stirred mechanically).

Convection is one of the ways we transfer heat from hot regions deep in the Earth to cooler, shallow regions.

# Heat Transfer

Other ways that heat can be transferred include *radiation*, *advection*, and *conduction*.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

**Advection** of heat is where some object carries an excess (or defecit of) heat energy from place to place.

**Conduction** is the transfer of heat (or electric current) from one substance to another by direct contact (lattice vibrations / electrons).

**Radiation** is the transfer of heat energy by photons that pass between two materials. It does not require any physical contact or indermediary material (e.g. it is not a problem to transfer heat across a vacuum this way).

# Conduction & Fourier's Law - i

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Fourier's Law** tells us how much heat, $Q$ is conducted through a sample in a unit time

$$
  Q=-\frac{k A \Delta T}{L}
$$

$A$ is the cross sectional area of the sample, $L$ is its length, $k$ is a thermal conductivity “constant” dependent on the nature of the material and often also on the temperature, and $\Delta T$ is the temperature difference across the sample. (Note the minus sign because heat will always flow from a higher temperature to a lower temperature.)

# Conduction & Fourier's Law - ii

**Fourier's Law** is explained using a simple thought experiment such as this one but it actually refers to the fact that heat
flows *down a temperature gradient*.

$$ q = - k \frac{dT}{dx} $$
:::

:::{.column style='width:80%; display: flex; align-items: center;'}
$q, (W/m^2)$ is called the heat flux and measures the flow of heat per unit area perpendicular to the temperature gradient
:::

# Thermal diffusion & Fourier's Law

If the heat flux into a region is not balanced by the heat flux out, the region must change temperature. For example, if more heat flow into a region than is flowing out, it will become warmer.

This process reduces the amplitude of temperature variations over time and makes the temperature smoother. **Temperature extremes become smaller, gradients become lower, the heat flux everywhere becomes smaller: the temperature differences *decay* through time.**

## Newton's Law of Cooling

Another example of "thermal decay" occurs when we have a
hot body in a cool environment loosing heat through its surface
according to the Fourier Law.

::::{.columns style='display: flex; align-items: center;'}

:::{.column  style='width:55%;'}

The heat flux is proportional to the difference in temperature between the hot object and the surroundings, so

$$
  \frac{dT}{dt} \propto T - T_0  \quad \rightarrow \quad T = T_1 e^{-\lambda t}
$$

This is exactly the same equation for the anomalous temperature as for the quantity
of a radioactive isotope remaining after a certain time
and has the same solution with $\lambda$ a constant for a particular experiment.

## Thermal diffusion

If a region has a different heat flux in v. out, then there must be a gradient in the heat flux. A change in temperature is driven by gradients in the heat flux like this:

$$
   \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =  -\frac{1}{\rho C_p} \frac{\partial q}{\partial x} + H
$$

$H$ is internal heat generation which is often important in the Earth because of the decay of radioactive isotopes.  Now we substitute for $q$ from Fourier's Law and have this expression:

$$
   \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =  \frac{k}{\rho C_p} \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + H
$$

Fourier was one of the first to solve this mathematically and developed
his method of summing harmonics (series solutions) as part of this study.

# Thermal Diffusion and Planetary Heat flow

The rate of heat loss is a primary controller of how a planet evolves.

  - The heat loss controls the internal temperature of the planet and
   its mechanical properties are expected to be dependent on temperature

  - The rate of heat loss from the interior is related to the energy
    available to supply mechanical work to deform the planet

  - The rate of heat loss governs the amount of time the planet can remain
    "geologically" active before the interior stops exchanging with the surface / atmosphere.


# Surface temperature and Heat loss

The Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us the rate at which a hot object loses heat to its surroundings.

$$
P = \varepsilon \sigma A \left( T^4_\textrm{hot} - T^4_\textrm{ambient} \right)
$$

The average surface temperature of the Earth is about 15°C or 288K.
This implies a loss of heat at a rate of 2 x 10^17^ W globally (to the chill of space)
We can make some assumptions about the energy content of the Earth to
see how long this can be sustained.

$$
  \require{cancel}
  \require{color}
  \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{dE}{dT} { \color{blue} \frac{dT}{dt} } =
  \varepsilon \sigma A \left( T^4_\textrm{hot} - \bcancel{T^4 _\textrm{ambient}} \right)
$$

$$
  \require{cancel}
  t_\textrm{cooling} =
      \frac{\rho C_p V_\oplus}{\varepsilon \sigma A_\oplus}
      \int^{T_\mathrm{final}}_{T_{initial}} \frac{1}{T^4}dT =
      \frac{\rho C_p R_\oplus}{3 \varepsilon \sigma}
      \left( \frac{1}{T^3_\mathrm{final}} -
             \bcancel{\frac{1}{T^3_\mathrm{initial}}}
      \right)
$$

## Surface temperature and Heat loss (2)

Assuming an initial temperature of 1500K (molten rock observed at the Earth’s surface)
gives a cooling time of **250,000 years**.

That’s quite young !

What is missing / incorrect in this analysis ?

 - The incoming radiation from the sun (estimated 1.75 x 10^17^ W) implies
   the Earth’s surface is near equilibrium with the solar radiation
   and therefore we should not assume cooling to the cold depths of outer space
   (how long has this near-equilibrium been established ?)

 - The assumption that the Earth’s interior is isothermal
 - The assumption that heat loss from the interior to the surface is perfectly efficient

This analysis might be quite useful for a molten planet (magma ocean)
where the heat transport in a vigorously convecting interior is very efficient.
Once the planet begins to crystallise, conductive cooling through the
chilled surface layers becomes the rate-controlling process.

# Solution for the uniform conduction of heat out of a sphere

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
What is the **equilibrium** heat flow across a thin spherical shell ?

 - Heat flux in balances heat flux out
 - Account for heat generation within the shell

$$ Q_r = 4\pi r^2 \cdot q_r(r) $$

$$ Q_{r+\delta r} = 4\pi (r+\delta_r)^2 \cdot q_r(r+\delta_r) $$

::::

The steady solution has this form

$$
  T = -\frac{\rho H}{6 k} r^2 + \frac{C_1}{r} + C_2
$$

Which is only interesting if there is internal heating ($H$)
and otherwise implies constant temperature / no additional heat at depth.
Steady-state, of course, tells us nothing about the age of the Earth.
$C_1$ has to be zero, for the solution to be meaningful at $r=0$.

# Transient solution for a sphere cooling from a uniform T

The transient (i.e. interesting) equivalent to this problem is qualitatively
different from the steady one. There are now variations with time and these
trade-off with variations in the radial direction.


Fourier’s approach was to find solutions in the form of a series of terms,
each of which individually satisfies the equations, but none of which, in isolation,
looks much like the actual solution.

The equation we want to solve looks like this:

$$
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}
                                  \left( \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)
$$

It says that the temperature changes due to radial temperature gradients and,
equally, that radial temperature gradients are established by the changes in temperature.

**NOTE:** I have left out the material “constants” like thermal conductivity, radius of the sphere, density which means I am assuming these are all 1 (and constant)

## Transient solution for a sphere cooling from a uniform T (2)

$$
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}
                                  \left( \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)
$$

We can look for solutions that take the form ...

$$
  T(r,t) = \frac{2}{r} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
                          \exp\left( n^2\pi^2 t \right) \sin(n\pi r) \cdot
                        \int_0^1 {\color{red}{f_T(r^*)}} \cdot r^* \sin(n\pi r^*) dr^*
$$

The term in red is the initial temperature distribution.
If we assume that this is uniform everywhere, then this is simplified
to the point where we can easily evaluate the solution:

$$
  T(r,t) = \frac{2}{r} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
                          \exp\left( n^2\pi^2 t \right) \sin(n\pi r) \cdot
                        \left( \frac{\sin(n\pi) - n \pi \cos(n\pi)}{n^2 \pi^2}  \right)
$$

## Transient solution for a sphere cooling from a uniform T (3)

$$
  T(r,t) = \frac{2}{r} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
                          \exp\left( n^2\pi^2 t \right) \sin(n\pi r) \cdot
                        \left( \frac{\sin(n\pi) - n \pi \cos(n\pi)}{n^2 \pi^2}  \right)
$$

Ignoring how we come by this (complicated-looking) solution for the time being,
what do these terms actually look like ?

![](images/CoolingSphere_Harmonics.png){height="300px" fig-align="center"}

A fundamental objection to Fourier's original approach to solving equations by
series solution is that the harmonics can violate the boundary conditions and other
physical constraints.

## Transient solution for a sphere cooling from a uniform T (4)

$$
  T(r,t) = \frac{2}{r} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
                          \exp\left( n^2\pi^2 t \right) \sin(n\pi r) \cdot
                        \left( \frac{\sin(n\pi) - n \pi \cos(n\pi)}{n^2 \pi^2}  \right)
$$

How do the harmonics look when added together to give an approximation to the
solution ?

![](images/CoolingSphere_Summation.png){height="300px" fig-align="center"}

The solution *does* satisfy the boundary conditions and the
physical constraints. **Note** that the smaller time solution has
much sharper gradients and many more terms are required to accurately
approximate the solution.

## Transient solution for a sphere cooling from a uniform T (4)

$$
  T(r,t) = \frac{2}{r} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
                          \exp\left( n^2\pi^2 t \right) \sin(n\pi r) \cdot
                        \left( \frac{\sin(n\pi) - n \pi \cos(n\pi)}{n^2 \pi^2}  \right)
$$

## Transient solution for a sphere cooling from a uniform T (5)

$$
  T(r,t) = \frac{2}{r} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
                          \exp\left( n^2\pi^2 t \right) \sin(n\pi r) \cdot
                        \left( \frac{\sin(n\pi) - n \pi \cos(n\pi)}{n^2 \pi^2}  \right)
$$

The temperature gradient at the surface is found by differentiating this
expression w.r.t. $r$ and evaluating at $r=1$

$$
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}(1,t) = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
                        \frac{2 e^{-n^2\pi^2 t}
                             \left( n\pi \cos(n\pi) -\sin(n\pi) \right)^2}{n^2 \pi^2}
$$

The surface heat flux is then given by

$$
  q_0 = -k\frac{\partial T}{\partial r}(1,t)
$$

## Transient solution for a sphere cooling from a uniform T (5)

$$
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}(1,t) = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
                        \frac{2 e^{-n^2\pi^2 t}
                             \left( n\pi \cos(n\pi) -\sin(n\pi) \right)^2}{n^2 \pi^2}
$$

# The cooling of a semi-infinite domain

::::{.columns}

:::{.column style='width:75%;'}

This is a problem not unlike the cooling sphere,
but with no inherent length scale that comes from the boundary
conditions. The equations are similar but we are working
in a Cartesian geometry (and also ignoring all the constants !)

$$
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}
$$

This equation simplifies to an ODE if we make the following substitution,

$$
  T^* = 1-T; \quad \eta = \frac{z}{2\sqrt{t}} \quad \rightarrow
      -\eta\frac{d T^*}{d \eta} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2 T^*}{d \eta^2}
$$

Which has the following solution

$$
\newcommand{\erf}{\mathop{\rm erf}\nolimits}
\newcommand{\erfc}{\mathop{\rm erfc}\nolimits}
  T^* = 1-\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^\eta e^{-\xi^2} d\xi
      = 1 - \erf(\eta)
      = \erfc\left(\frac{z}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)

This is a very different solution strategy to the cooling sphere
(and yet they should, in a mathematical sense,
approach each other as the radius becomes large).

The solution looks **very similar** in character: a cooling
front which propagates in from the surface.
The curves are self-similar, they just differ by a scaling factor.

# Navier-Stokes Equation: Constitutive Law

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}
                           + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} \right) =
                        \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} - g\rho\hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$

but to close this system of equations, we need to know how $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
relates to the momentum or velocity. In a Newtonian, viscous fluid:

$$ \tau_{ij} = \eta \left[ \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j} +  \frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i}\right]
   \quad \textrm{and} \quad
   \sigma_{ij} = \eta \left[ \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j} +  \frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i}\right] - \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i}
$$

are the *deviatoric* and *total* stress tensors, respectively. This definition
of the stress in terms of a material property ($\eta$, the dynamic viscosity), allows
us to write:

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}
                           + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} \right) =
                        \nabla \cdot \left[ \eta \left( \nabla \mathbf{v} +
                        \nabla \mathbf{v}^T \right)\right ] - \nabla p
- g\rho {\mathbf{z}}
$$

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}
                           + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} \right) =
                        \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} - \nabla p
- g \rho {\mathbf{z}}
$$
The second form assumes that the viscosity is a constant and produces the familiar form of the
Navier-Stokes equation. The first form is required if the viscosity varies.

# Navier-Stokes Equation / Convection


$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}
                           + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} \right) =
                           \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} - \nabla p
                           - g \rho_0 \alpha \left( T - T_0 \right)  {\mathbf{z}}
$$

$$
\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla T \right)=
                        \kappa \nabla^2 T + \frac{H}{C_p}
$$

We combine Navier-Stokes equation driven by thermal buoyancy, and the expression for
the time-evolution of the temperature field. The two equations are coupled through $T$.
The various physical properties and their units are listed below.

$$
\begin{array} {l|l|l}

## Non-dimensional Navier-Stokes

It should not matter if we work in SI units cgs units or Imperial units —
the physics does not change and the system does not care about our choice.
That means there should be a way to express the equations without having to
define specific units at all (or some sort of natural units for the problem
that make everything close to 1).^[*]^

We can rescale all our numbers by typical values of length, time,
temperature etc. We have to be consistent (remember dimensional analysis)
so these choices work, for example:

$$
\begin{array} {lll}
  x \leftarrow d . x' & \partial / \partial x \leftarrow  (1/d) . \partial / \partial x' & \nabla \leftarrow (1/d) \nabla' \\
  t \leftarrow d^2 / \kappa . t'   & \partial / \partial t \leftarrow  (\kappa/d^2) . \partial / \partial t' & \mbox{} \\
  T \leftarrow \Delta T . T'   & \mbox{} & \mbox{} \\
  \mathbf{v} \leftarrow (\kappa / d)  \mathbf{v}' & \mbox{} & \mbox{} \\
  p \leftarrow p_0 - (\eta \kappa / d^2 ) p'   & \textrm{Note:} \; \nabla p_0 = - g \rho_0 & \mbox{} \\
\end{array}
$$

</br>

[*] this is what people used to do — feet / inches for carpenters, furlongs for farmers / horses.

## Non-dimensional Navier-Stokes (2)

$$
\frac{\rho_0 \kappa}{d^2} \frac{D}{Dt'} \left( \frac{\kappa}{d} \mathbf{v}' \right) =
                \frac{\eta}{d^2} \acute{\nabla}^2 \left( \frac{\kappa}{d} \mathbf{v}' \right)
                - \frac{\eta \kappa}{d^3}  \acute{\nabla} p' + g \rho_0 \alpha \Delta T T' {\mathbf{z}}
$$

Tidying up as much as we can:

$$
\frac{\rho_0 \kappa^2}{d^3} \frac{D\mathbf{v}'}{Dt'}  =
                \frac{\eta \kappa}{d^3} \acute{\nabla}^2  \mathbf{v}'
                - \frac{\eta \kappa}{d^3}  \acute{\nabla} p' + g \rho_0 \alpha \Delta T T' {\mathbf{z}}
$$

Divide throughout by $\eta \kappa / d^3$ gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\rho \kappa}{\eta} \frac{D\mathbf{v}'}{Dt'}  & =
                     \acute{\nabla}^2  \mathbf{v}'  -  \acute{\nabla} p' +
                     \frac{g \rho_0 \alpha \Delta T d^3}{\kappa \eta} T' {\mathbf{z}} \nonumber \\
           & \textrm{or} \\
    {\color{DarkRed}\frac{1}{{\rm Pr}}} \frac{D\mathbf{v}'}{Dt'} & =
    \acute{\nabla}^2  \mathbf{v}'  -
    \acute{\nabla} p' + {\color{DarkRed} {\rm Ra}} T' {\mathbf{z}}
\end{aligned}
$$

We have separated out the form of the equation from its scaling by going through this process.
The primed variables can be re-inflated to their normal size using the scalings from the previous slide.
The new parameters in the equation are dimensionless ratios (they have to be since all the primed variables
are ratios).

## Non-dimensional Navier-Stokes (3)

**Rayleigh number** - measures the intensity of the buoyancy forces and their ability to counter the effects
of thermal diffusion and viscosity in damping motion driven by buoyancy

$$
\mathrm{Ra} = \frac{g \rho \alpha \Delta T d^3}{\eta \kappa}
$$

**Prandtl number** - measures the relative importance of stress diffusion and thermal diffusion and is purely a
material property (no reference to the geometry, length- or time-scales).

$$
\mathrm{Pr} = \frac{\eta}{\rho \kappa} = \frac{\nu}{\kappa}
$$

**Reynolds number** - measures the relative importance of inertial to viscous forces. The Reynolds number is commonly
used in fluid dynamics where it is an indicator of the transition from steady flow, unsteady laminar flow, through to
turbulent flow.

$$
\mathrm{Re}=\frac{\rho V_0 d}{\eta} = \frac{V_0 d}{\nu}
$$

The Reynolds number does not contain any reference to the thermal state but this means that there
is no natural length/time scaling and so the definition can be subjective.

## Non-dimensional Navier-Stokes (4)

Questions

  - What is the Prandtl number for (1) Water, (2) A planet ?
  - What is the Reynolds number for plate-tectonic motions ?
  - Estimate the Rayleigh number for the Earth.

Discussion points:

  - If the Prandtl number is very large, how long does it take for the Navier-Stokes equation
    to adjust to changes in buoyancy forces or boundary conditions ?

  - What is the Reynolds number for mantle flow / plate tectonics ?
    How about for flow in the Earth's outer core ?

  - A similar scaling question: what (roughly) is the kinetic energy of the Pacific plate ?

# Incompressible flow and the stream function

In all the derivations so far we assume two incompatible things:

  - $\rho$￼is constant (i.e. $\nabla\cdot \rho \mathbf v \equiv \rho_0 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}$￼)
  - Flow is driven by buoyancy forces that result from changes in density

It is not unusual to make the approximation that fluids are incompressible
(even for air if the Mach number is “small”) and we do not lose a lot of detail if we do this.
We assume that the density variations are small so they are only important when they appear in a term that
does not depend on the actual density but only the density gradient (e.g. buoyancy)

  - This is called the Boussinesq approximation.

Pressure becomes a constraint parameter rather than a physical pressure (cf a Lagrange multiplier)
and the constraint equation is:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0
$$
    ￼
Constrained PDEs can be very hard to solve, but there are some tricks
that allow us to directly incorporate the pressure constraint.

## Incompressible flow and the stream function (2)

The stream-function is a scalar quantity which defines a 2D incompressible flow everywhere.
It satisfies:
$$
v_1 = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_2}; \quad
v_2 = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_1} \quad
{\color{DarkOrange} \textrm{compare this to }
\mathbf{v} = \nabla \times (\psi {\mathbf{k}})
\textrm{: the curl of an out-of-plane vector}
 }
$$

and this automatically implies
$$
\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_2} = 0 \quad
\textrm{(i.e. incompressibility)}
$$
and
$$
(\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \psi =
                        v_1 \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_1} +
                        v_2 \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_2} =
                        \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_1} -
                        \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_1} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_2} = 0
$$
i.e $\psi$ does not change as a result of advection


Note: a more general, 3D version of this derivation is the Helmholtz decomposition
of a vector field into [irrotational]{style="color:DarkGreen;"} and a
[solenoidal]{style="color:DarkRed"} (divergence free) parts:

$$
  \mathbf{u} = {\color{DarkGreen} \nabla \phi} +
               {\color{DarkRed} \nabla \times \mathbf{A}}
$$￼

## Incompressible flow and the stream function (3)

Vorticity is defined as  $\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}$￼ but in 2D,
there is just one component of this equation and we treat it as a scalar ($\omega \leftarrow \omega_3$￼)

$$
\omega = \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_1} -
         \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x_2}
$$

If we take the curl of the Navier-Stokes equation we find we can eliminate
the pressure gradients as $\nabla \times \nabla P \equiv 0$￼.
For infinite Prandtl number, the L.H.S vanishes.

$$
\frac{1}{\rm Pr} \left( \frac{D \boldsymbol{\omega}}{D t} -
                (\boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} \right) =
                    \eta \nabla ^2 \boldsymbol{\omega} + {\rm Ra} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1}
$$ {#eq-stokes-vorticity}

Now, $\mathbf{v} = (-\partial \psi / \partial x_2, \partial \psi / \partial x_1, 0)$￼
implies that $\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \nabla ^2 \psi = \omega$
￼ and, if we substitute this into
$$
  \color{DarkRed} \nabla^4 \psi = -{\rm Ra} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1} \textrm{(the biharmonic equation)}
$$

where $\nabla^4$￼is known as the biharmonic operator and is defined to be


$$
\nabla^4 \equiv \nabla^2 ( \nabla ^2) \equiv
                    \left( \frac{\partial ^4}{\partial x_1^4} +
                    \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_1^2} \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_2^2} +
                    \frac{\partial ^4}{\partial x_2^4} \right)
$$



# Does the rotation of the Earth matter ?

The Navier-Stokes equation describes the momentum balance in a viscous fluid in response to buoyancy forces and pressure gradients.
In a rotating system, we may also need to consider the influence of Coriolis, and centrifugal forces

$$
\rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \rho\left( \mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla \right) \mathbf{v} +
2 \rho \boldsymbol{\Omega}\times \mathbf{v} + \rho \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left( \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{x}\right)
= \nabla \eta \left( \nabla \mathbf{u} + \nabla\mathbf{u}^T \right) - \nabla p - g \rho_0 \alpha  \left( T - T_0 \right)  {\mathbf{z}}
% \frac{1}{\mu_0}\nabla\times\mathbf{B}\times\mathbf{B}
$$

$\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ is the rotation rate vector which we can also write as $\;\boldsymbol{\Omega} \equiv \Omega_0 \mathbf{z}$

$$
\frac{\rho _0 \kappa}{\eta _0}\left[ \frac{\partial \mathbf{v'}}{\partial t'} +
\rho\left( \mathbf{v'}\cdot \nabla' \right) \mathbf{v'} + 2 {\Omega_0} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \times \mathbf{v'} \right]
- \nabla' \eta \left( \nabla' \mathbf{v'} + \nabla'\mathbf{v'}^T \right) + \nabla' p^{*^{'}} =
\frac{g \rho_0 \alpha \Delta T d^3}{\kappa \eta} T' {\mathbf{z}}
$$

Pressure-like terms are all gathered into $p^*$ and include contributions from the centrifugal force term

Imagine a tank of **thick, viscous fluid** (like syrup, for example). This turns out to be a reasonable model for the interior of a solid (rocky / icy) planet if we consider the evolution on a geological timescale. A cold / dense blob of material sinks and stirs a tank of fluid just like this computer model shows.

# What is viscosity ?

**Viscosity** is a measure of the resistance of a fluid to deform under shear stress. It is commonly perceived as "thickness", or resistance to flow. Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction. Water is runny, having a lower viscosity, while honey is "thick" having a higher viscosity.

*The right image is from the University of Queensland [Pitch Drop Experiment](https://smp.uq.edu.au/pitch-drop-experiment)*


## What is viscosity (ii)?


::::{.columns}

:::{.column style='width:50%;'}

Viscous deformation is an irreversible *flow* that occurs in response to an applied shear stress.
The stress is found to depend on the strength of the shearing *velocity gradient*.


$$
  \tau = \eta \frac{d v_1}{d x_2}
$$


Think of this as the stress that resists the shear deformation, i.e. how hard it is to stir the fluid. This is much harder if the fluid is **more viscous**.
Or think of it as how fast the fluid responds to a given force (e.g. gravity) so a viscous gravity current will spread **more slowly** if the viscosity is high.

Viscosity only opposes the formation of velocity gradients; not a driving force, only a resistance.

Now let us think about how the physical properties of the fluid and the boundary conditions change how this blob behaves.

$$ \textrm{Activity} = \frac{\textrm{Whatever tends to enhance the flow}}{\textrm{Whatever tends to retard the flow}} $$

We will consider how the behaviour changes with various parameters. When we change a parameter does it tend to enhance flow or retard it ?

Is the flow moving faster when the box is larger ?



# Convective Activity

**Intuition** from these simple toy models produces the same dominant effects as
we obtained from the non-dimensionalisation.

$$
\mathrm{Activity} \propto \frac{\textrm{buoyancy} \times d}{\kappa \eta}
$$

cf. Rayleigh number that we found earlier.

$$
\mathrm{Activity} \propto \frac{\color{blue}{g\rho_0\alpha\Delta T} d^3}{\kappa \eta}
$$

The advantage of the detailed analysis / re-scaling, is that we obtain the true
dimensionless ratios.




# Thermal Convection

In very-viscous convection, only the Rayleigh number plays a role
($\mathrm{Re}\rightarrow 0$ and $\mathrm{Pr} \rightarrow \infty$)

The structure of the flow and the pattern of the temperature field is predictable once we know the Rayleigh number but it is helpful first to develop some feeling for the patterns by seeing them.

*Blue  is cool, red is warm. The bottom of the box is kept hot, the top cold and the difference in temperature is $\Delta T$, the depth of the box is $d$ and so on. These numbers are set up so that the Rayleigh number is the required value. In a lab experiment, the simplest parameter to change is $\Delta T$ assuming that the material has a constant viscosity with $T$ and does not freeze, melt, burn or boil.*

# Steady State Convection

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="60%"}

In many of the examples, we reach a *steady state* in which the system
stops changing and the movies appear to be frozen.

However, this steady state actually represents a dynamic balance between:

  * heat conduction into and out of the model at the bottom and top respectively
  * heat advection by continual rotation in the fluid that drags hot material between the two boundaries

# Understanding Thermal Convection

<center>

![](images/blt.png){style="height:300px;"}
</center>

A relatively simple pattern emerges from the competition between advection of heat by fluid flow and diffusion:

  - Convection cells that become independent
  - Boundary layers where horizontal advection balances vertical diffusion
  - Rotation in the middle of the box without much deformation

## Understanding Thermal Convection (ii)

<center>
![](images/blt.png){style="height:200px;"}
</center>

Convection length and timescales are determined by the Rayleigh number.

   - High $\mathrm{Ra}$ narrower boundary layers, higher temperature gradients

   - High $\mathrm{Ra}$ more likely to be time-dependent, unsteady

   - Low $\mathrm{Ra}$, convection suddenly shuts off

We will see this picture again when we consider the patterns of heat flow in the Earth's ocean floor.

# Average temperature

![](images/ConvectionTgrads.png){style="height:350px;"}
![](images/NuExperiment.png){style="height:350px;"}

The temperature (velocity, stress etc) profiles vary systematically with $\mathrm{Ra}$.

# Nusselt number

Another, independent, dimensionless quantity can be derived for the convecting system and it is called the *Nusselt number*.

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}

$$ \mathrm{Nu} = \frac{Q d}{k \Delta T} $$

Which is the ratio of the heat transported in the convection model ($Q$)
compared to what would be transported if
only conduction were at work. It turns out that

$$ \mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/3} $$

![](images/NuExperiment.png)

*The results (right) are from an experiment using liquid He which
could not be much more different that solid rock but the principals
still hold and the agreement with theory is excellent*

# Boundary layer approximation

<center>
![](images/blt.png){style="height:200px;"}
</center>

  * &nbsp;

  * Thin horizontal boundary layers  where heat diffuses into the
    layer and is carried away by horizontal advection.
    These are connected by vertical boundary layers of similar dimension.

  * Gradients along boundary layers are typically on a scale of the layer depth
  (large so leads to small gradients). Gradients across the boundary layers are
  typically large because the boundary layers are thin

## Boundary layer approximation (2)

For the vertical thermal boundary layer, assume that:

$$
  \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_2} \sim \frac{V}{\delta} ; \quad
  \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_1} \sim \frac{V}{d} ; \quad
  v_1 = 0 ; \quad
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1} \sim \frac{\Delta T}{\delta} ; \quad
$$

Then the curl of the Stokes equation (or the biharmonic equation, substituting for the stream function),

$$
\frac{\partial^3 v_2}{\partial x_1^3} - \frac{\partial^3 v_1}{\partial x_2^3} +
\frac{\partial^3 v_2}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2^2} - \frac{\partial^3 v_1}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1^2} =
\frac{g\rho\alpha}{\eta} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1}
$$

becomes

$$ \frac{V}{d^3} + \frac{V}{d\delta} \sim \frac{g\rho\alpha}{\eta} \frac{\Delta T}{\delta} \quad \quad
 {\color{DarkRed} \frac{Vd^3}{d\delta^2} \sim \frac{g\rho\alpha d^3}{\eta} \frac{\Delta T}{\delta}}
$$


## Boundary layer approximation (3)

For the energy equation, assume steady state:

$$
  \kappa \nabla^2 T = \left( \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla \right) T
$$

For the horizontal thermal boundary layer, assume that:

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1} \sim \frac{\Delta T}{d} ; \quad
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x_2} \sim \frac{\Delta T}{\delta} ; \quad
  v_1 \sim V ; \quad v_2 \sim 0
$$

Then the curl of the Stokes equation (or the biharmonic equation, substituting for the stream function),

$$
\frac{\partial^3 v_2}{\partial x_1^3} - \frac{\partial^3 v_1}{\partial x_2^3} +
\frac{\partial^3 v_2}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2^2} - \frac{\partial^3 v_1}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1^2} =
\frac{g\rho\alpha}{\eta} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1}
$$

becomes

$$   \kappa \nabla^2 T = \left( \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla \right) T \quad \quad
 {\color{DarkRed} \frac{\kappa \Delta T}{\delta^2} \sim \frac{V \Delta T}{d}}
$$

## Boundary layer approximation (4)

Now we have $V/d \sim \kappa / \delta^2$ and some rearrangement of the previous approximations gives us

$$
  V \sim \frac{\kappa}{d} \textrm{Ra}^{2/3}
$$

and

$$
  \textrm{Nu}^{-1} \sim \frac{\delta}{d} \sim \textrm{Ra}^{-1/3}
$$

This approach balances the transfer of momentum and thermal energy vertically into the horizontal boundary layer (diffusion)
with advection of each quantity along the boundary layer in a steady state.

# Critical Rayleigh number

It can be a little difficult to see from a small set of movies, but if we reduce the Rayleigh number enough, conduction completely wins over advection and no motion takes place at all.

<center>
![](images/crit_ra.png)
</center>

This can be approached theoretically, and we find that there is a critical value of the Rayleigh number and a critical wavelength where this transition occurs.

$$
 \mathrm{Ra}_c = \frac{27}{4} \pi^4 = 657.51 \quad \textrm{and} \quad
 k = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}} = 2.22
$$

If $\mathrm{Ra} \gg \mathrm{Ra}_c$ then convective motion is inevitable

  - Density, $\rho_0 \approx 3000 \mathrm{kg/m}^3$
  - Thermal Expansivity, $\alpha \approx 10^{-5} \mathrm{K}^{-1}$
  - Temperature drop, $\Delta T \approx 2000 \mathrm{K}$
  - Thickness of the mantle, $d \approx 3000 \mathrm{km}$

# Summary

Convection is a heat engine (i.e. it converts heat energy into mechanical work)

Convection is a balance between heat transported by fluid motion and diffusion.
The fluid self-organises to create large scale patterns *“out of nowhere”*

In tanks of viscous fluids like syrup or honey, convection depends on just the one free parameter
which is a combination of fluid properties, geometry and boundary conditions — this is called the Rayleigh number (Ra).

If we know Ra, we can predict the heat flow and typical velocity of the system

If Ra is below a critical value, convection dies away but if it is more than (about) ten times this value then convection cannot be suppressed. The Earth’s mantle is very much super-critical and so it must be convecting.

None of these simple models actually produce plate tectonics but they do still tell us about the heat flow in the Earth.
