# General Principles of Geology

Geologists don't get to choose the experiments they would like to see the Earth perform for them.  They compare events from different places (and times) and assume they can generalize processes.

# Planetary Scale Comparisons

<center>
![](images/orbits-planets-bodies-solar-system.jpg){height="350px"}
</center>

It's much harder to find analogues when it comes to processes on the scale of the whole planet. We can try to look at other planets in the solar system.

## Planetary Scale Comparisons (2)

<center>
![](images/Moons2Scale.png){height="400px"}
</center>

We can also look at the mini-solar systems of the giant planets. Some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are the size of small planets.

## Planetary Scale Comparisons (3)

<center>
![](images/MoonsPlusDwarfPlanets.jpg){height="400px"} &nbsp;
</center>

There are a number of dwarf planets and asteroids that are of significant size and that we can use as analogues for theories of planetary geology.

## Planetary Scale Comparisons (4)

<center>
![](images/ExoplanetsGalore.jpg){height="400px"} &nbsp;
</center>

It would be nice if we could add all the exoplanets into this story but, regardless of the detail shown in these images, we only really know mass, radius and surface temperature.

## Solar System Comparisons

<center>
![](images/SolarSystem_vs_Trappist.tiff){height="400px"} &nbsp;
</center>

Look at how close these exoplanets are to their star and look at their orbital periods. Trappist is a cool dwarf star but the habitable zone around it is debated. Do you think these Earth-like images are a fair representation of the weather systems ? Tidal heating, spin-orbit coupling, intense radiation / magnetic fields are likely to affect these planets as they do the moons of Jupiter in our solar system.

## Venus Facts

Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS -2023)

 - Venus is likely a geologically active planet today. Several lines of evidence together suggest that volcanic activity takes place today on Venus, and the planet’s record of tectonic deformation speaks to recent and perhaps even ongoing deformation.

 - Models show that the young surface is consistent with Venus being habitable for billions of years. New climate models indicate that Venus could have had modern-Earth-like conditions until as geologically recently as about a billion years ago, before entering a runaway greenhouse driven by several simultaneous, major volcanic eruptions.

 - Exoplanet discoveries motivate renewed Venus exploration. The ongoing detection of large, rocky exoplanets close to their host stars, especially those that are amenable to having their atmospheres characterized, increasingly requires that we better understand the atmospheric properties and climate history of Venus.

## Mars Facts

Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS -2023)

 - Detection of organic matter in the lake sediments of Gale Crater indicating past indigenous organic chemistry in a martian habitable environment.

 - Presence of massive mid-latitude deposits of water ice. There are large areas in Mars’s northern lowlands where hundreds-meter thick ice slabs occur  meters below the surface.

 - Possibility of current or recent near-surface liquid water. Enrichments of salt in near-surface rocks and sediments and features that change seasonally with warm temperatures suggest small amounts of liquid water shaping martian geology even in the modern cold, dry climate regime.

 - Multiple types of habitable environments were widespread across ancient Mars.  Evidence for lakes, rivers, playas, groundwater systems, and hydrothermal systems of varying temperatures and water chemistries, preserved in the rock record at thousands of locations, an environmental diversity similar to Earth.

## Mars Facts (pt 2)

 Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS - 2023) pt 2

  - Kilometer-thick layers of H2O ice and CO2 ice in the martian polar caps formed less than 10 million years ago. Radar analyses of polar deposits, coupled with climate models, indicate that much of the ice thickness of Mars’s poles is a product of *recent* climate change.

  - Loss of H~2~O and CO~2~ to space and sequestration in crustal minerals were major factors in the evolution of the atmosphere and climate. Spacecraft measurements coupled with modeling show that Mars’s climate became drier and colder because of both escape of volatiles to space and their sequestration in minerals in its crust.

  - Data from the InSight lander recorded frequent marsquakes up to magnitude 4 that allowed probing the martian interior: a thick, fractured crust, mantle structure, with a liquid core that includes a sizeable fraction of light elements.

  - Ancient alkali-silica-rich igneous rocks. Data from orbiters and Gale crater have discovered more than just basaltic rocks on Mars. High alkali and silica rocks indicate more differentiated magmas.

  - Mars is active. Dynamic activity includes: migrating sand dunes, recurring slope lineae formation, changing ice landforms, methane release, and marsquakes.

## Mercury Facts

Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS - 2023)

 - Mercury is a volatile-rich world. Despite being closer to the Sun, concentrations of volatile elements are more abundant on Mercury than on Venus or Earth, and are comparable with Mars.

 - Mercury’s offset magnetic field and dynamic magnetosphere were revealed by MESSENGER. Mercury’s large metallic core generates an axially dipolar dynamo magnetic field that is 1) low intensity relative to Earth’s and 2) offset by approximately 20% of the planet’s radius to the north.

 - Permanently shadowed regions near Mercury’s poles hold abundant water ice. Ice deposits exist either at the surface in a relatively pure, thick layer or beneath organic-rich lag deposits. Water ice may have been delivered by comets or asteroids or micrometeoroids, from the solar wind, or outgassing from Mercury’s interior.

 - Mercury’s oldest surfaces contain high abundances of carbon that may be remnants of a primary graphite flotation crust from an early magma ocean. Much of the surface, however, was subsequently covered by extensive floods of lava of varying composition.

# Earth's Moon

</center>

## Earth's Moon Facts

Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS -2023)

 - GRAIL produced the highest resolution gravity field measurements of any object (including Earth). Data revealed the Moon’s crust to be far more fractured and porous than expected and exposed previously undiscovered global-scale magmatic-tectonic features, elucidated the formation and evolution of impact basins, and constrained models for both the bulk composition and formation of the Moon.

 - New analyses of lunar samples provide insights into its formation and physicochemical evolution. Volatile elements are depleted in the lunar interior. Essentially identical isotopic compositions between Earth and Moon for nonvolatile elements strongly challenges prior Earth–Moon origin models.

 - Additionally, paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples have revealed that the Moon once generated a core dynamo that persisted for over 2 billion years and had surface field strengths comparable to the current Earth.

 - Geochronological studies of lunar samples have elucidated the Moon’s formation age, which ties into our understanding of the timing of giant impacts during planetary accretion.

## Earth's Moon Facts (2)

Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS -2023)

- Lunar volcanism was thought to have ended well over 1 billion years ago, but images from Lunal Reconaissance Orbiter revealed irregular patches of basaltic deposits that may have erupted within the past 100 million years.

- Newly discovered tectonic features indicate locations of eruptions may be influenced by tidal interactions with Earth and orbital recession away from Earth, and movement along these faults likely continues into the present day.

- images of craters that have formed after LRO began its mission indicate that impacts affect the surface far from the impact site, and secondary cratering overturns regolith at rates more than 100 times higher than previously thought.

- Water ice lies at the surface within some regions of permanent shadow at the Moon’s poles. New results confirm that at least some polar H is present as H2O, although its origin and abundance is still not known.

Atlas is ~2km deep and ~90 km in diameter. The crater floor is peppered with hills, rifts and fractures that surround a clearly visible central mountain (seen casting a shadow). Some of the crater’s features are thought to have been influenced or shaped by volcanism e.g. the branching web of deep fissures and cracks stretching throughout the crater, known as Rimae Atlas.

## Jupiter's Moons Facts

Jupiter’s four large Galilean moons reveal the fundamental importance of gravitational tides in generating internal heat, producing the giant volcanoes on Io and melting ice on Europa and Ganymede.

- [Galilean Moons Factsheet: Ganymede](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/ganymede/facts)

- [Galilean Moons Factsheet: Europa](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/europa/facts)

These moons orbit close to a giant, active planet with strong gravity, intense radiation and magnetic fields. They might turn out to be good analogues to some of the hot exoplanets we saw earlier.






<!-- We have to stop somewhere !!
# Saturns Moons

At Saturn, we see a suite of smaller, ice-rich moons of uncertain age that likely experienced tremendous dynamical upheaval (some of which are still active today), one large ice-rock world, and a number of smaller outer captured moons. Saturn’s lone large moon, Titan, has a dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere, with wind-blown dunes and organic precipitation producing Earth-like river channel systems, lakes and seas, suggesting a world akin to an early Earth in hibernation in the colder regions of the outer solar system.

## Earth Facts

We think of the Earth a little differently from the other planets, and so, usually does NASA. But their factsheet follows the same pattern and it is interesting to think about the Earth as "just another planet".

 - [Earth factsheet](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/)

 Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.

 Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.

## Earth - Relative thickness of Crust and Lithosphere

<center>
![](images/LithosphereRelativeThickness.svg){height="425px"}
</center>

This map shows the relative thickness of the crust and the lithosphere (thick crust is dark). You can immediately see how important the mechanical structure of the lithosphere is when it comes to the response to geological stresses. *The coloured dots are earthquake hypocentres coloured by depth and mostly show where the slabs are located.*

## Earth - Global Stress

<center>
![](images/World_Stress_Map.jpeg){height="350px"}
</center>
The World Stress Map (WSM) 2016 displays the contemporary crustal stress orientation in the upper 40 km based on the WSM database release 2016. Lines show the orientation of maximum horizontal stress. The colours indicate whether stresses are associated with a) Normal faulting, b) strike-slip faulting, or c) thrust faulting.Note that the **magnitude** of the stress is not part of this map.

## Earth - Global Seismicity

The magnitude of the stress is related to the rate of seismic energy release because this is a measure of those places which are under enough stress for the lithosphere to "break".

</center>

Usually this takes the form of a fault that already exists sliding because the shear stresses are large compared to the confining pressure.

## Earth - Global Strain rate

<center>
![](images/GlobalStrainRate.png){height="350px"}
</center>

The strain rate is a measure of how fast deformation is taking place. Strain rate is a measure of the rate of change of length (units are $s^{-1}$) *and* it is a tensor: there are multiple components that represent normal and shear strains. The measure shown here is an average (the second invariant).

The rate of deformation is related to two things: the stress applied and the strength of the material.

</small>

## Earth - Global Volcanism

<center>
![](images/GlobalVolcanismMap.png){height="350px"}
</center>

Volcanic activity is distributed similarly to that of seismicity and mostly occurs at convergent and divergent plate boundaries. There is also a significant level of intra-plate volcanism. Magma pathways within the crust are influenced by the stress field and we can analyse volcanic structures to determine the ambient stress field at the time they were formed.

The Earth has a strong, dominantly dipolar, magnetic field which reverses chaotically but relatively regularly. These two features together allow

 - paleo-latitudes to be determined
 - ocean floor ages to be determined.

The morphology and bathymetry information comes to life when combined with
the magnetic intensity maps of the mid-ocean ridge system. Chaotic magnetic reversal patterns combined with "steady" spreading produces a symmetric stripe-pattern that reflects the aging of the sea floor.

The linkages among the components of sediment routing systems: the source area (erosion), the transfer zone (rivers etc), and sinks (basins, deltas). In each zone, sediment may be stored temporarily, or accumulate in sinks if there is sufficient long-term accommodation.

## Earth - Summary

We have huge advantages in understanding the Earth because we have nearly unlimited access to the surface, limited access to the subsurface by drilling, digging, sampling. We can go "wherever we want" to take measurements or samples.

We can set up imaging experiments that have long timescales and global reach.  On other planets, we have shorter experiments and everything is significantly limited in terms of duration and access.

We have huge fleets of observing satellites and remote telemetry of discrete sensors.
