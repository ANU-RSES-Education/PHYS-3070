# General Principles of Geology

Geologists don't get to choose the experiments they would like to see the Earth perform for them.  They compare events from different places (and times) and assume they can generalize processes.

# Planetary Scale Comparisons

It's much harder to find analogues when it comes to processes on the scale of the whole planet. We can try to look at other planets in the solar system.

## Planetary Scale Comparisons (2)

<center>
![](Images/Moons2Scale.png){height="400px"}
</center>

We can also look at the mini-solar systems of the giant planets. Some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are the size of small planets.

## Planetary Scale Comparisons (3)

<center>
![](Images/MoonsPlusDwarfPlanets.jpg){height="400px"} &nbsp;
</center>

There are a number of dwarf planets and asteroids that are of significant size and that we can use as analogues for theories of planetary geology.

## Planetary Scale Comparisons (4)

It would be nice if we could add all the exoplanets into this story but, regardless of the detail shown in these images, we only really know mass, radius and surface temperature.

## Venus Facts

Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS -2023)

 - Venus is likely a geologically active planet today. Several lines of evidence together suggest that volcanic activity takes place today on Venus, and the planet’s record of tectonic deformation speaks to recent and perhaps even ongoing deformation.

 - Models show that the young surface is consistent with Venus being habitable for billions of years. New climate models indicate that Venus could have had modern-Earth-like conditions until as geologically recently as about a billion years ago, before entering a runaway greenhouse driven by several simultaneous, major volcanic eruptions.

 - Exoplanet discoveries motivate renewed Venus exploration. The ongoing detection of large, rocky exoplanets close to their host stars, especially those that are amenable to having their atmospheres characterized, increasingly requires that we better understand the atmospheric properties and climate history of Venus.

between it is smoother lava plains. The plains are cut by polygonal
cracks and folded by wrinkle ridges. Plains lavas have flowed into
linear cracks in the tessera, indicating that the plains lavas came
after the tessera.Image: NASA / JPL / mapaplanet.org / Emily Lakdawalla*

## Mars Facts

Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS -2023)

 - Detection of organic matter in the lake sediments of Gale Crater indicating past indigenous organic chemistry in a martian habitable environment.

 - Presence of massive mid-latitude deposits of water ice. There are large areas in Mars’s northern lowlands where hundreds-meter thick ice slabs occur  meters below the surface.

 - Possibility of current or recent near-surface liquid water. Enrichments of salt in near-surface rocks and sediments and features that change seasonally with warm temperatures suggest small amounts of liquid water shaping martian geology even in the modern cold, dry climate regime.

 - Multiple types of habitable environments were widespread across ancient Mars.  Evidence for lakes, rivers, playas, groundwater systems, and hydrothermal systems of varying temperatures and water chemistries, preserved in the rock record at thousands of locations, an environmental diversity similar to Earth.

## Mars Facts (pt 2)

 Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS - 2023) pt 2

  - Kilometer-thick layers of H2O ice and CO2 ice in the martian polar caps formed less than 10 million years ago. Radar analyses of polar deposits, coupled with climate models, indicate that much of the ice thickness of Mars’s poles is a product of *recent* climate change.

  - Loss of H~2~O and CO~2~ to space and sequestration in crustal minerals were major factors in the evolution of the atmosphere and climate. Spacecraft measurements coupled with modeling show that Mars’s climate became drier and colder because of both escape of volatiles to space and their sequestration in minerals in its crust.

  - Data from the InSight lander recorded frequent marsquakes up to magnitude 4 that allowed probing the martian interior: a thick, fractured crust, mantle structure, with a liquid core that includes a sizeable fraction of light elements.

  - Ancient alkali-silica-rich igneous rocks. Data from orbiters and Gale crater have discovered more than just basaltic rocks on Mars. High alkali and silica rocks indicate more differentiated magmas.

  - Mars is active. Dynamic activity includes: migrating sand dunes, recurring slope lineae formation, changing ice landforms, methane release, and marsquakes.

Less that 1 Gyr ago, there was liquid water flowing across Mars. This has significant implications for atmospheric pressure and temperature at that time.

## Mercury Facts

Key Discoveries from the Past Decade (NAS -2023)

 - Mercury is a volatile-rich world. Contrary to earlier predictions, and despite being closer to the Sun, concentrations of elements that evaporate at moderate temperatures are more abundant on Mercury than on Venus or Earth, and are comparable with those on Mars.
 - Mercury’s offset magnetic field and dynamic magnetosphere were revealed by MESSENGER. Mercury’s large metallic core generates an axially dipolar core dynamo magnetic field that is enigmatic owing to its low intensity relative to Earth’s and the offset of the center of the dipole by approximately 20 percent of the planet’s radius to the north.
 - Permanently shadowed regions near Mercury’s poles hold abundant water ice. Many regions on Mercury where water ice is predicted to be thermally stable appear to host such ice deposits either at the surface in a relatively pure, thick layer or beneath organic-rich lag deposits. The origin of these deposits is not yet known, but water ice may have been delivered by comets or asteroids or micrometeoroids, from the solar wind, or outgassing from Mercury’s interior.
 - Volcanism played a critical role in shaping Mercury’s surface. Mercury’s oldest surfaces contain high abundances of carbon that may be remnants of a primary graphite flotation crust from an early magma ocean. Much of the surface, however, was subsequently covered by extensive floods of lava of varying composition indicating geochemically diverse terrains on Mercury’s surface that hint at a heterogeneous interior.
